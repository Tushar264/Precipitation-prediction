🌧️ Precipitation Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict daily precipitation in Los Angeles based on historical weather data. Built entirely in a single Jupyter Notebook, it walks through the full ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

📌 Overview
Goal: Predict rainfall based on weather attributes (e.g., temperature, humidity).

Dataset: 1,000+ historical records for Los Angeles.

Accuracy: Achieved 93% accuracy using classification models.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📘 What’s Inside
The notebook includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Training multiple classification models

Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

🔍 Key Highlights
Used supervised learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Visualized correlations and feature importance

Achieved strong predictive performance with minimal overfitting

📁 File
precipitation_prediction.ipynb — Main notebook containing all code, analysis, and results

💡 Future Scope
Extend to multi-city or time-series data

Deploy model via a web interface (Streamlit/Flask)

Automate retraining on new data
